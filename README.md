## 3T3L1 adipocyte LOPIT 

- This repository contains the code used for the computational analysis of "Dynamic
subcellular proteomics identifies novel regulators of adipocyte insulin action",
submitted to BioRxiv 2025. 

- We performed LOPIT-DC in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (mouse
adipocyte cell line) to determine changes in protein localisation in response to
acute insulin and CL316,243 (B3-AR agonist) stimulation.

### Repository structure

This repository is split into 4 main sections (1) data processing: filtering, normalisation, aggregation of PSM to protein level quantitation, (2) data visualisation, (3) setting up BANDLE for differential localisation analysis and subcellular protein classification, and (4) evaluation of the BANDLE results including checking for convergence, post-allocation filtering and the extraction of differentially localising proteins.
