## 3T3L1 adipocyte LOPIT 

- This repository contains the code used for the computational analysis of "Dynamic
subcellular proteomics identifies novel regulators of adipocyte insulin action",
submitted to BioRxiv 2025. 

- We performed LOPIT-DC in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (mouse
adipocyte cell line) to determine changes in protein localisation in response to
acute insulin and CL316,243 (B3-AR agonist) stimulation.
